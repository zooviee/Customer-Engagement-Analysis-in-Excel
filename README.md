# Customer-Engagement-Analysis-in-Excel

## Case Description
In 2022, there were high expectations for the growth of the 365 company and
increased student engagement based on the introduction of new website platform
features. Some of these features included an XP system that enabled students to track
their progress, level up, and earn rewards by completing various learning objectives.
The platform also offered in-app coins that could be exchanged for special awards, a
leader-board where students could compete for top positions in different divisions,
earning weekly rewards and advancing up the ladder, and streaks to motivate students
to maintain consistent learning habits. Additionally, the company expanded its course
library, covering a broader range of topics to provide its students with a richer set of
skills and attract a larger audience. These enhancements were anticipated to positively
impact the student experience, create an effective strategy for customer engagement,
and contribute to the company's success in the coming year. With this Customer
Engagement Analysis in Excel project, you must analyze whether the new additions
to the platform have increased student engagement.

## Project files
During this Customer Engagement Analysis in Excel project, you’ll analyze a dataset
from the 365 company. It’s important to note that personal user information has been
masked to ensure privacy, and the database's volume has been reduced for practical
reasons. Nevertheless, you can consider this dataset to accurately represent the
company’s operations—providing a realistic and relevant context for your analysis.
In addition, consider the following information about the column values while
working with the data:
1. Student_id – the unique identifier for each student in the dataset. The field
contains IDs for students who used the 365 Data Science platform with free or
paid accounts in Q4 2021 (October 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021, both included)
and Q4 2022 (October 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022, both included).
2. Student_country – identifies the country of each student. The field provides
information about students’ geographic location and can help analyze regional
differences or conduct country-specific analyses.
3. Paid – indicates whether a student had a paid account during the specified period.
It is a binary variable, where '1' represents a paid account and '0' represents a free
or unpaid account. It helps differentiate between students who have access to
additional features or content through a paid subscription.
4. Minutes_watched_21 – represents the student’s engagement level, as expressed
by the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2021.
5. Minutes_watched_22 – denotes the student’s engagement level, as expressed by
the number of minutes a student has watched in Q4 2022.
The Excel file 'Engagement Project.xlsx' consists of four sheets: Task 1 and 2, Task 3,
Task 4, and Task 5. Each sheet contains specific information regarding the project's
tasks and corresponding data. Use the data in these sheets to answer the questions that
follow.
